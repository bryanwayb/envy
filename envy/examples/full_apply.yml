# #yaml-language-server: $schema=./apply_schema.json

# A default "root" target is implied which allows for simple configs if desired
# This is similar to doing the following:
#name: 'root'
# The default section name cannot be changed

# Defines a list of targets that will resolve before attempting to run operations
# Apply will only attempt to run targets that it can resolve on the current machine
# This allows for a single configuration to be shared across multiple machines
targets:
  # Below will only run when running on a Windows machine
  - os: windows # os is required when specifying a target

    # By default type = 'local', this is similar to the following
    # type: local

    # -- WARNING -- Contexts are a planned experimental feature and may not be fully supported

    # Operations can be scopped to a context, by default the context is set to "system", like so:
    context: system
    # Contexts can be one of the following: system, user, directory (can also just be a path, like below)
    # context: ./context/path

    # System will apply to the entire system and will typically need to be ran as admin/root
    # User should only need to modify files that the current user is able to modify, but only applies to the current user
    # Directory will only perform the operations in either the current directory (if set as "directory") or the specific path
    #   When using directory with a relative path a "." needs to be supplied first
    operations:
      - install: choco:git

  # Below will only run when running on a linux machine with an ubuntu or debian distributions
  - os: linux
    distributions: # TODO: Should this be a more generic name to allow for Windows editions as well?
      - ubuntu
      - debian
    operations:
      - install: apt:git

# It's also possible to specify a list of operations without targets
# This allows for a simple configuration but nothing will be performed if the required package managers doesn't exist
# This is not recommended when an apply config is being shared across machines and operation systems
#operations:
#- install: choco:git

# Defines a list of sections that can be used to do command line targeting
# Sections are also useful for organizational grouping
sections:
  # "ide" section, installed when no specific target is passed
  # can be targeted directly by apply -f ./apply ide
